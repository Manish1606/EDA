        "Q3.What is the distribution of car prices for each transmission type, and how do the interquartile ranges compare?\n",
        "==>In the used car market, cars with automatic transmissions generally have a higher price distribution compared to those with manual transmissions, and their interquartile ranges (IQR) also tend to be wider. This means the difference between the 25th and 75th percentile prices for automatic cars is larger than for manual cars, indicating a broader range of prices within the middle 50% of the distribution.\n",

        "Q4.What is the distribution of car prices across different regions?\n",
        "==>Car prices vary significantly across different regions due to factors like taxes, registration fees, and local market conditions. For example, in India, on-road car prices can differ greatly between states. Some states may have higher road taxes or additional local charges, leading to higher final prices.\n",

        "Q6.How does the average selling price of cars vary by customer gender and annual income?\n",
        "==>The average selling price of cars is strongly correlated with both customer gender and annual income. Higher income generally allows for the purchase of more expensive vehicles, and there are often observed gender-based differences in car preferences and negotiating power, which can impact the final price.\n",

        "Q8.How does the average car price differ between cars with different engine sizes?\n",
        "==>Generally, larger engine cars are more expensive than smaller engine cars, but it's not always a simple relationship. Factors like manufacturer costs, standard equipment, and taxes can also influence price.\n",
        "Manufacturer Costs:\n",
        "     Larger engines can be more expensive to build, requiring more complex components and manufacturing processes.\n",
        "Standard Equipment:\n",
        "      Larger engines may come with more standard features, such as a larger infotainment system or a more powerful audio system, which adds to the overall price.\n",
        "Taxes:\n",

        "\n",
        "Q9.How do car prices vary based on the customerâ€™s annual income bracket?\n",
        "==>To decide a car budget based on your salary, a common rule of thumb is to limit your car's on-road price to 50% of your annual income. Additionally, aim to keep car-related expenses (EMI, insurance, fuel, maintenance) within 10-15% of your monthly salary.\n",
        "* Calculate your annual income: Determine your net annual salary   (salary after deductions).\n",
        "* Apply the 50% rule: Multiply your net annual salary by 0.5. This gives you a rough budget for the car's on-road price.\n",
        "* Factor in running costs: Don't forget to budget for fuel, insurance, and maintenance costs.\n",
        "* Consider your lifestyle and needs: Choose a car that fits your lifestyle and the number of people in your family.\n",

        "Q12.How does the average car price vary across different car models and engine types?\n",
        "==>The first step to differentiate between car models is to know your inventory inside and out. You should be familiar with the specifications, prices, warranties, and reviews of each model you have in stock. You should also be aware of the availability, delivery time, and special offers of each model."

This distribution is often not uniform, with some items experiencing deeper discounts than others. The presence of both shallow and deep discounts, as well as potential \"holes\" within the price range, can indicate a multimodal distribution, meaning there isn't a single typical discount level.\n",

In a scatter plot, each point represents a song, with the x-axis representing the song's duration and the y-axis representing its popularity (e.g., play count, views, etc.). By visually examining the distribution of these points, trends and correlations between the two variables can be observed.\n",
